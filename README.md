# Visualizing-And-Prediction-of-Stock-Price

Simply put, stock market cannot be accurately predicted. The future, like any complex problem, has far too many variables to be predicted. The stock market is a place where buyers and sellers converge. When there are more buyers than sellers, the price increases. When there are more sellers than buyers, the price decreases. So, there is a factor which causes people to buy and sell. It has mo re to do with emotion than logic. Because emotion is unpredictable, stock market movements will be unpredictable. Itâ€™s futile to try to predict where markets are going. They are designed to be unpredictable.
