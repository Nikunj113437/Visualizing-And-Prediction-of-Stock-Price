# Visualizing-And-Prediction-of-Stock-Price

Simply put, stock market cannot be accurately predicted. The future, like any complex problem, has far too many variables to be predicted. The stock market is a place where buyers and sellers converge. When there are more buyers than sellers, the price increases. When there are more sellers than buyers, the price decreases. So, there is a factor which causes people to buy and sell. It has mo re to do with emotion than logic. Because emotion is unpredictable, stock market movements will be unpredictable. It’s futile to try to predict where markets are going. They are designed to be unpredictable.

There are some fundamental financial indicators by which a company’s stock value can be estimated. Some of the indicators and factors are : Price-to-Earning (P/E) Ratio, Price-to-Earning Growth (PEG) Ratio, Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio,
Price/Cash Flow (P/CF) Ratio, Price-to-Book Value (P/BV) Ratio and Debt-to Equity Ratio. Some of the parameters are available and accessible on the web but all of them aren’t. So, we are confined to use the variables that are available to us.

The proposed system will not always produce accurate results since it does not account for the human behaviours. Factors like change in company’s leadership, internal matters, strikes, protests, natural disasters, change in the authority cannot be taken into account for relating it to the change in Stock market by the machine.

The objective of the system is to give an approximate idea of where the stock market might be headed. It does not give a long-term forecasting of a stock value. There are way too many reasons to acknowledge for the long-term output of a current stock.
Many things and parameters may affect it on the way due to which long term forecasting is just not feasible.

#### For this Project, I take Data of Stocks from Yahoo Finance, and applying SVR(Support Vector Regression) along with HyperParameter Tuning with Grid Search CV to in order to optimize the Parameters of SVR so that it will give Best Possible Accuracy of Stock Price.
#### And For Visualization Of Opening, Closing Price and Predicted Price of Stock through Graphs, Plotly is Used.

## Inputs from User:
In this Project, I take 3 inputs from User:<br>
                      1. Stock Code<br>
                      2. Date Range (in which it is showing opening and closing Price of Stock)<br>
                      3. No. of Days in which it will predict Price of Stock in near Future
